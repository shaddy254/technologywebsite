    <P>An operating system is a software that is responsible for managing
      all the resources in computer and intergrating them to create an 
      interface between the computer and the user</P>
      <p>The are some many other fuctions of the operating system in regard to 
          the functionality of the computer.some of the functions of the operating system include;
          <ul>
              <li>Processor management-it involves managing all the currently running processes 
                by assigning them time afterwhich it is terminated on the end of processing 
                time so as to create time for other processes in the queue.  </li>
                <li>Memory Management- the operating system allocates memory to running processes
                    and after execution returns the memory and uses the optimization techniques 
                    to enhance the overral system performance.
                </li>
                <li>File management-this involves storing data and information inform of files,
                    the os hereby manages all file systems in the computer by giving the user 
                    options like create,modify,delete,append,rename among others </li>
                <li>Device Management- the operating system is responsible allocating,managing
                     and deallocating  all input/output devices to the running processes at any
                     given time they are requested.</li>
                <li></li>
