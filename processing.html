    <h1>classification of computers</h1>
            <h2>classification acccording to data proccessing</h2>
            <p> computers can be classified according to the functionality and the type of data that
            the computer can handle.data to be processed by a computer can either be discrete or 
            continours in nature.In classification according to functionality we hereby get three 
            types of computers.
                <ul>
                <li> Digital computers</li>
                <li>Analogue computers</li>
                <li>Hybrid computers</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Digital computers</h3>
            <p>They are computers that provide data that is discrete in nature.these computers therfore
            perfoms calculations and operations that are reprisented in digits either 1 or 0.the 
            Digital computers are therefore capable of performing mathematical calculations,organize
            and analyze data and  perform othe industrial processes.A good example of these computers
             Digital stopwatches 
            </p>
        <h4>Analogue computers</h4>
            <p>These are types of computers that can perfom and manipulate data that is continous in nature.
            These computers are said to use continous and changing aspects of pysical facts such as weather
            and distance. examples of computers in this classification include;
                <ul>
                <li> weight machines</li>
                <li>thermometer</li>
                <li>stethoscope</li></ul>
            </p>
        <h5>Hybrid computers</h5>
            <p>These are the types of computers that are said to exhibit both the analogue and the digital characteristics
            the computers accept data that is anaolugue in nature,convert it into digital form and then process it in a 
            digital manner, some good examples of these computers are the computers that are found in Icu wards and also
            computers that are used in scientific laboratories.</p>
        <h6>classification according to purpose</h6>
             <p>computers can classified according to the purpose or ideal job they were developed to perform
            in this classification we get computers like the general purpose computers and special purpose computers.
            </p>
        <h5>special purpose</h5>
            <p>The special purpose computers are the computers that are designed to perform only one specific task.
            these computers cannot  perform any othe task apart from that they are dedicated for.This is therefore
            one of the major disadvantages of these types of computers.however these computers may  have the same 
            features as  the general purpose computers , there applicability to one job makes them different.special 
            pupose computers can be used in  controlling robots,traffic lights controll,satellite launch among others.
            due to the fact that they are dedicated to one job memory is not wasted and hence they are fast in data 
            manipulation.
            </p>
        <h6>General purpose computers</h6>
            <p>These are computers that are designed to perform any task that comes on their ways.This property remains to be 
            the main advantage of general  purpose computers over the special purpose computers.The general purpose computers 
            can perform any task provided that they are loaded with the apropriate programs,some of the tasks that can be 
            performed by these computers include scientific calculations,inventory management,controlling security systems 
            among others. 
            </p>
        <h6>classification according to size</h6>
        <p>In this classification,computers are clasified according to their physical size,in this classification the computers 
            with the largest physical size  perform more complex tasks than those with small physical sizecomputers in this generation include,
        <ul>
            <li>super computers</li>
            <li>main-frame computers</li>
            <li>mini computers</li>
            <li>micro computers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>super computers</h4>
        <img src="supercomp.jpg" alt="" width=" 70%" height=500">
        <p>This are the largest computers to be developed,they are characterized by  covering a large surface area almost the size of 
           of a room ,consuming alot of electricity and producing alot of heat,a very high speed in operation,a large internal storage
           capacity,and the most expensive computers in the universe.some of the activities that can be perfomed by these computers 
           include;
           <ul>
               <li>Are used in research by scientists to compute and model the properties of biological compounds like proteins 
                   and human blood</li>
                <li>are used in military research to test  new aircrafts</li>
                <li>are used in entertainment to  help make flawless online games</li>
                <li>are used by meterologists to predict weather and earthquakes</li>
                were the first to be developed then the smallest ones are the last to be developed, <li>are used to test nuclear weapon detonations</li>
           </ul>

        </p>
        <h4>main-frame computers</h4>
        <img src="mainframe.jpg" alt=""width=" 70%" height="500">
        <p>They are medium size like computers as compared to the super computers,they are characterized by storing data in magnetic disks and of less
             computation speed than that of the super computers,they are used in airline reservations and film industry 
            <ul>
                <li>They are used in hospitals mainly for data recording</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>

            </p>
        <h4>mini computers</h4>
        <img src="minicomp.jpg" alt=""width=" 70%" height="500">
        <p>
            They are small machine as compared to the  main-frame computers and have a higher capabilities of multi-tasking.
            these computers are less expensive as compared to the main-frame and super computers.some of their uses include;
             <ul>

        </p>     
        <h4>micro computers</h4>
        <img src="microcompu.jpg" alt=""width=" 70%" height="500">
        <p>
            These are the smallest computers and got their name micro since they use a micro processor as their processor.
            The first microprocessor was developed in 1970 by Tedd hoff,most of the micro computers are portable and they 
            are the cheapest computers in the town.Some of the examples of the micro-computers include the  desktop computers,
            palmtops,laptops,ipads,PDAs among others.
            <ul>
                <li>desktop computers-these are the computers that are developed to be placed on a desk</li>
                <li>laptops-these are highly portable computers that are developed to   be placed on the palms.</li>
                <li>PDAs-personal digital computers that are small in size and portable.</li>
                <li>smartphones- are types  of small computers that can fit on the pockets</li>
            </ul>
