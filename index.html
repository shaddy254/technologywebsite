                <h2>HISTORY OF COMPUTERS</h2> 
                <p>In this topic you will be able to know the history and the start of 
                    computing in the world which started in the early 40s
                </p> 
                <h3>FIRST GENERATION COMPUTERS</h3>
                <img src="images.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The first generation computers were the first computers to be developed                                                                                                                                                            
                    in around 1940s,this computers were characterised to 
                    store data in magnetic vacuums  and were of large size,this 
                    computers were charactrized by a very slow in operation but 
                    consumed alot of heat.
                   
                </p>
                <h2>The main features of the first generation are − </h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vacuum tube technology</li>
                        <li>Unreliable</li>
                        <li>Supported machine language only</li>
                        <li>Very costly</li>
                        <li>Generated a lot of heat</li>
                        <li>Slow input and output devicesy</li>
                        <li>Huge sizey</li>
                        <li>Need of AC</li>
                        <li>Non-portable</li>
                        <li>Consumed a lot of electricity</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>     
                <h3>second generation</h3>
                <img src="second generation.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="400">
                <p>these are the second computers to be developed in the year 1950s
                    they had a reduced size and were more reliable than the first 
                    generation,these computers used the the transistors as their 
                    technology.these computers had a small size than the first generation.  
                </p>
                <h4>third generation</h4>
                <img src="third generatio.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="400">
                    these computers were more reliable than the first and the second generation 
                    computers,these computers had a speed of 1,000,000 operations per second and 
                    were multitasking in nature.it is during this generation that saw the 
                    introduction of the use of intergrated circuits.
                <h2> fouth GENERATION</h2>
                <img src="fouthg.jpg" alt=""width="70%" height="400">
                <p>
                    
                    Fourth-generation computers were introduced in the 1970’s and developed 
                    with microprocessor chip which contains a central processing unit (CPU) on
                    a single silicon chip. They perform on the Arithmetic Logical unit and
                    control unit of the CPU. these are the computers we use today and are 
                    multitasking in nature.
                </p>
                <h4>fifth generation</h4>
                <img src="fifth.jpg" alt=""width="70%" height="400">
                <p>
                these are the computers that are believed to be developed  from today onwards 
                and are said to have a human like thinking capabilities,these computers are 
                developed with the use of artificial intelligence.</p>
